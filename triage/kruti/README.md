# Predict-COPD-Exacerbations
This was the capstone project in 'R' for the course Machine Learning Methods batch # 1909 submitted by Kruti Shah.
The course covered the feature reduction techniques and 40 + Macine learning methods from Regression, classification and clustering. The Capstone project was prepared to demonstrate the above learnings. We were expected to use atleast one feature reduction technique and 4-5 machine learning algorithms. PCA is used as the feature reduction technique. The Machine learning methods used are KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, ANN and Xtreme Gradient Boosting. There are different set of features considered and each algorithm is run against all the different sets of features. Finally the output from all the algorithms are compared for the best results.

## Business problem and question
 COPD affects 12.7 million Americans and costing nearly $50 billion annually. Each year, COPD leads to more than 700,000 hospitalizations
Approximately 19.6% of patients hospitalized in the United States are
readmitted within 30 days, accounting for an estimated expense of $17 billion annually . In an attempt to improve clinical outcomes and control rising healthcare costs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
(HRRP), which imposes financial penalties on hospitals with excessively high readmission rates for specific conditions, such as heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia.

 These CMS imposed penalties are geared to begin the process of moving to a patient-centric, disease management system in which the patients are trained and supported as they learn to participate in the management of their illness. To develop a tool to triaging patients with COPD to reduce the occurrence and re-occurrence of exacerbations requiring multiple hospitalizations will help Optum develop cost-saving strategies as it relates to COPD exacerbation.  

## Question: 
Can we predict COPD exacerbations based on the provided data i.e. patient background characteristics, current clinical symptoms, and physiologic measurements using the machine learning methods? 

Based on these predictions, COPD exacerbation rapid action plan from the data can be developed.
This rapid action plan can be used to 
a.	educate and train the patient and family to self-monitor and 
b.	self-manage post discharge to lower the likelihood of unnecessary hospitalization for patients with COPD
